Good evening... umm... I don't really know you, and I can't see or hear you, but I must maintatin that I'm most enchanted that you are able to read what I wish to communicate and in doing so are fulfilling one of my foremost desires, that of spreading the knowledge of my home world across this solar system. I hope my English is legible and that you are able to understand what I write, for our knowledge of your world is limited and even though I've spent a large part of my life learning your language, I'm afraid that my command over it is not yet perfect and that you must forgive any misgivings that you might observe over the course of this text.

As I mentioned earlier, this is a chronicle of the life of Rorcadraians, and an attempt at keeping our legacy intact in the off chance that our world may be destroyed by some unexpected calamity. Our people have attempted to contact other worlds like the Earth in the hopes of providing a certain level of redundancy to the information that we are broadcasting.

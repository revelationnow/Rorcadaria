Good evening... umm... I don't really know you, and I can't see or hear you, but I must maintatin that I'm most enchanted that you are able to read what I wish to communicate and in doing so are fulfilling one of my foremost desires, that of spreading the knowledge of my home world across this solar system. I hope my English is legible and that you are able to understand what I write, for our knowledge of your world is limited and even though I've spent a large part of my life learning your language, I'm afraid that my command over it is not yet perfect and that you must forgive any misgivings that you might observe over the course of this text.

As I mentioned earlier, this is a chronicle of the life of Rorcadraians, and an attempt at keeping our legacy intact in the off chance that our world may be destroyed by some unexpected calamity. Our people have attempted to contact other worlds like the Earth in the hopes of providing a certain level of redundancy to the knowledge and culture of our world. My purpose in this text is very specific as we broadcasters have been assigned very specific aspects of our world to prepare for dissemination to all the worlds, oweing in part to our expertise on that particular subject and in part to our command over the primary language of the planet to which we are disseminating our knowledge.

Over the course of my life, I have been educated and have been responsible for the education of other Rorcadarians in the field of what you would call Sociology. Though the field I study may not be an exact analogue of sociology, it is, I believe, close enough in its scope for you to have a general idea of what is to follow in the remainder of this transmission.

Our society is made up of two different kinds of individuals, I'm not entirely sure which of the diverse classifications of the humans beings would be analogous to this. You can consider us as having two different races or two different genders or two different species. The difference between the two kinds of Rorcadarians is possibly a mixture of all these different classifications. 
The first kind of Rorcadarian, the kind that I am, is called a Rorca and the other type is called the Daria. We eat food like humans do for sustenance, our food however is not consumed through a mouth, rather we consume our nutrition through our skin which is an excellent screen for separating the unnecessary and harmful constituents of our food from the necessary ones. We don't have any external organs specialized to providing the means of locomotion, rather we are always surrounded by an electro-magnetic field that keeps us floating above the surface of our planet. The field, we have come to believe, is necessary for our internal processes as air is for human beings. As we move upwards, away from the planet, this field becomes weaker, and there have been many instances of daredevils attempting amazing feats that involve travelling away from our atmosphere into outer space as humans call it, only to find that within a few minutes, in human time, they would start suffocating and their skin would begin to peel and eventually they would die a painful death in about 15 minutes. Rorcadarian scientists have been able to create an artificial electro-magnetic field to help these space farers, but it is one of the marvels of technology that didn't exist when the many daredevils I mentioned earlier gave up their lives for science. Coming to the distinction between the Rorcas and the Darias, the differences are mostly physical, but apart from that, we are essentially the same people. Rorcas have the shape of a hemisphere, flat on one side and round on the other. We have two eyes on each side and have a 360 degree view of the world. The Darias are the opposite of this, they too have a flat surface on one side, however the other side is a concave hemisphere. If you have some difficulty imagining, think of it as a object that if attached to a hemisphere, would make a cylindrical object. Both our people have a radius of 3 - 4 feet and Rorcas tend to generally be the smaller of the two.

The Rorcadarian society has a very fluid, yet predictable structure with no bias in favour of either Rorcas or Darias.
